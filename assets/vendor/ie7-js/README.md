ie7-js
======

Dean Edward's original code is from http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/

I have stripped down the code in the same way Integralist did in http://github.com/Integralist/Dean-Edwards--IE-7-and-8-and-9

Plus, I changed it to load css files asynchronously so that it does not block. This fixed the notable performance issue for me.
